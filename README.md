# local-library-project
This project explores advanced functions like find, map, sort, reduce, and forEach to support a basic library website. There are three large data sets: authors, books, and accounts that were provided by Thinkful.
In addition to the advanced functions, this uses arrow functions, ternary operators, and accessing properties of objects within objects and arrays.
